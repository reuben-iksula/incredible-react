# incredible-react
## Goal
To do a practical react project and to mimick the desktop equivalent of https://incredible-template.webflow.io/
Here are the received rules:
1. Create website refer link above
2. The site should be a desktop replica
3. Use react.js and tailwind to build the design
4. Use dummy content api (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to populate content
5. Add basic form validation and on submit it should show a success msg
6. make it responsive on tablet and mobile (optional)

## Limitations
Some sections are not mobile/tablet responsive as that was optional.
There are some spacing issues that have risen due to changing styles to suit responsive design after going a desktop first approach.
